# -rySubRipper

For several years I tried to find on the net the subtitles for some rare tv shows that came with hardcoded subtitles in their original language.

Having tried the few available applications available for ripping subs without success. I’ve finally started this project for personal use.

My objective was to quickly have a working application that produces accurate subtitles for series using the same set of characters through all the episodes. Of course, you can use @rySubRipper to rip movie subtitles. Just be aware that by starting each time with a different set of subtitle characters, the ripping process will take longer because of the OCR learning curve.

With that goal in mind, I chose a “binary comparison” technology as opposed to a standard OCR (more flexible but also more complex and unreliable).

That said, accuracy has its price and ripping a tv show episode takes a lot of user time even once the machine learned the basic characters.

If you are looking for an application where you press a button and leave for your computer to work alone, you can stop reading now and delete it from your disk.

The quality of the video and the contrast between the subtitles and the background images will have a huge impact on the ripping time and the manual work. You can have scenes where the machine turns alone for several minutes and scenes where you have to interact every second. Ripping a 20-minute episode can take a few working hours.
